### Promotional Text (<= 170 chars)

Stop face‑touching habits with gentle, private reminders. Brrrrr uses your Mac camera on‑device—no recording, no tracking, just awareness.

### App description (long, <= 4000 chars)

Brrrrr is a lightweight menu bar app that helps you notice hand‑to‑face touches in real time. When you’re working, it watches for hands near your face and gives a gentle alert so you can build awareness and break the habit.

How it works:
- Start monitoring from the menu bar.
- See a live preview (normal or dots) and a status indicator: no touch / maybe / touching.
- Choose your alert style: sound, screen blink, or both.
- Tune cooldown, volume, and flash intensity.
- Adjust processing rate to balance speed and CPU usage.

Private by design:
- Camera frames are processed on‑device.
- No photos or video are recorded or stored.
- No microphone access.
- No tracking or analytics.

Brrrrr is a general wellness / awareness tool and is not a medical device.

### Review notes (for App Review)

Brrrrr requires Camera access to run Vision-based hand + face landmark detection. The app:

- processes frames on-device,
- does not record video or take photos,
- does not access the microphone,
- does not upload data.

The UI is a menu bar app. Open the popover from the menu bar icon to view the camera preview and status. Settings are available from the gear button or right‑click menu.
