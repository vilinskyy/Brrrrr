## Privacy Policy — Brrrrr

Effective date: 2026-01-18

This Privacy Policy explains how **Brrrrr** (“the app”) handles information when you use it.

### Summary (plain English)

- **No data collected**: Brrrrr does not collect personal data.
- **On-device processing**: camera frames are processed locally to detect hand-to-face touches.
- **No recording**: Brrrrr does not record or save photos or video.
- **No microphone**: Brrrrr does not access the microphone.
- **No sharing**: Brrrrr does not sell or share your data.
- **No tracking/analytics**: Brrrrr does not include third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs.

### Information we collect

**None.** Brrrrr does not collect personal information, usage analytics, device identifiers, or crash/telemetry data.

### Camera usage (what happens to the video)

Brrrrr requests access to your Mac’s **camera** so it can analyze **live video frames** and detect hand-to-face touches. The video is:

- processed **in memory** on your device,
- **not recorded**,
- **not stored**,
- **not uploaded** or transmitted,
- **not used** to identify you,
- **not used** to train models.

### Microphone

Brrrrr **does not access the microphone** and does not request microphone permissions.

### Network / Internet

Brrrrr’s core functionality is designed to work without network access and does not send data to the developer. If you installed the direct-download version, the app can optionally connect to GitHub to check for updates when you choose “Check for Updates…”. No analytics or personal data are sent. (If you choose to open external links in your web browser, your browser may make network requests — that is outside the app.)

### Sharing with third parties

Brrrrr does not share data with third parties because it does not collect data.

### Children’s privacy

Brrrrr is not designed to collect information from anyone, including children.

### Changes to this policy

If the app’s privacy behavior changes, this policy will be updated and the “Effective date” will change.
